- RFC PR: N/A

# Abstract
First RFC is prepared as the self-defining structure of ideation, proposals and discussion traits being done while working on the Pileus project.

# Motivation
The intention of giving birth to this standardized way of work is to allow ideas to reach day light early as conceptualized.

# Guide-level explanation


# Drawbacks
This system is a plain text model with the option to include images visible in view mode.

# Rationale and alternatives

# Prior art
This process isn't a novelty. It's going to bring the best practices from other development processes, particularly Rust language development RFCs and Oxide Computer RFD interpretation. First is very established standard and the second helps break initial resistance to constitute ideas as written impressions.
