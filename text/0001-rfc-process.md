# Drawbacks
This system is a plain text model with the option to include images visible in view mode.

# Rationale and alternatives
There are many very developed solutions ofered by project management platforms. This solutions doesn't exclude additional usage of other tools but it keeps center of development in GitOps native way.

# Prior art
This process isn't a novelty. It's going to bring the best practices from other development processes, particularly Rust language development RFCs and Oxide Computer RFD interpretation. First is very established standard and the second helps break initial resistance to constitute ideas as written impressions.
